const trainingLogistics = `For RPL training, student intakes happen every week. The course is two weeks long; with the first being theory, and the second practicals. Theory is done at the main office at Prosperity House in Westlands, and practicals at Sigona Drone Space Airfield. The training aircraft needs to be registered with the KCAA under our training organisation in order for flight time to be logged, therefore it is not necessary to bring your own drone for training purposes. The drone shall not be flown less than 50m from a road, people or property, within a 10km radius of any airport or aerodrome or higher than 400ft above ground level and 500 metres in distance (Visual Line of Sight (VLOS)). For insuring your drone while it's in flight: Drone insurance requires the pilot to hold an RPL, the drone to be registered with KCAA and the flight to be conducted under an ROC. All Licenses are issued by the regulator who is Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA). The KCAA aproved doctors are: Dr. Wanjohi: (0722 833 492, wambakiwanjohi@gmail.com) and Dr. Phenny: (0722 302 086, kphenny123@gmail.com). The RPL license forms part of the RPAS Operators Certification. However, an RPL alone would not qualify you to run a legal commercial operation. We may assist with the ROC consultation process.`;
